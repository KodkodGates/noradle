<div id="title"> Deployment & Configuration & Administration of PSP.WEB  </div>

  The PSP.WEB software is tested on ORACLE DATABASE 11gï¼ˆEE & XE) and NodeJS v0.6.2.

Install at oracle's side
===

## Install PSP.WEB engine schema objects and demo schema objects.

  Change working directory into oracle, use sqlplus to login into the target oracle database as sysdba, then execute install.sql script file. Example like this:

	sqlplus "sys/password@targetdb as sysdba"
	SQL> @install

  Note that the psp user and demo user should be created beforehand, then you will be prompted to specify the names of the two database users.

## Configure oracle to nodeJS TCP/IP connection

  Oracle DB is able to make TCP/IP connection to outside world by `UTL_TCP` pl/sql API, but by default, oracle forbit network ACL to make connection to any address, you must use `DBMS_NETWORK_ACL_ADMIN` package to create a new ACL to allow access to nodeJS listener. NodeJS http server will manage all the connections made by oracle, and use them as communication path for the http gateway behavior.The configuration script is as the following code:

	exec dbms_network_acl_admin.create_acl('pwgw.xml','oracle2nodejs',principal => 'PSP',is_grant => true,privilege=> 'connect');
	-- dbms_network_acl_admin.add_privilege('pwgw.xml',principal => 'PSP2',is_grant => true,privilege => 'connect')
	exec dbms_network_acl_admin.assign_acl(acl => 'pwgw.xml', host => '192.168.177.1')
	commit;
	
	-- The "principal" parameter in "dbms_network_acl_admin.create_acl" must specify the schema that hold the PSP.WEB engine software, it's case sensitive. use "dbms_network_acl_admin.add_privilege" to grant right to other db user that act as PSP.WEB engine user.
	-- The "host" parameter in "dbms_network_acl_admin.assign_acl" must specify where the nodeJS http gateway is for dns/hostname or ip address.

## Configure core parameter for **server\_config\_t** table

  Upon completion of installation, The SERVER\_CONTROL\_T table is configured by the following insert statement

	insert into SERVER_CONTROL_T (GW_HOST, GW_PORT, MIN_SERVERS, MAX_SERVERS, MAX_REQUESTS, MAX_LIFETIME, STATIC_URL)
	values ('127.0.0.1', 1522, 6, 12, 1000, '+0001 00:00:30','http://127.0.0.1:81');	

  To let PSP.WEB known where the nodeJS http gateway is, You must specify `GW_HOST and GW_PORT columns for SERVER_CONTROL_T`. The nodeJS http server as PL/SQL gateway is listening for oracle connection at tcp address of `GW_HOST:GW_PORT`.

  The above insert will create a config called 'default', you can create additional config by insert multiple records of server\_config\_table, and specify column cfg\_id as the name of the new configuration. That way, you can allow multiple nodeJS gateways to reverse-connect to one oracle database.


## Make sure there is enough processes/sessions and background job process for PSP.WEB service.

  The value `in SERVER_CONTROL_T.MIN_SERVERS` control how many server processes PSP.WEB use to service the client(through nodeJS gateway), but PSP.WEB server process is just oracle's background processes, the actual number of them is controled under the following oracle init parameters, so ensure it's set big enough to run the amount of PSP.WEB server processes required.

	* JOB_QUEUE_PROCESSES
		specifies the maximum number of processes that can be created for the execution of jobs. It specifies the number of job queue processes per instance (J000, ... J999). 
	* PROCESSES
		specifies the maximum number of operating system user processes that can simultaneously connect to Oracle. Its value should allow for all background processes such as locks, job queue processes, and parallel execution processes.
	* SESSIONS
	specifies the maximum number of database sessions that can be created in the system. Because every login requires a session, this parameter effectively determines the maximum number of concurrent users in the system.

  To know the current value of the parameters above, use "show parameters {parameter-name}"

  To change the setting., use "alter system set {parameter-name}={value}"
	
	

## Start and Stop PSP.WEB server on oracle side

  PSP.WEB server is run as scheduler managed background job processes, They run as the PSP.WEB engine software database user, normally is "PSP". PSP.WEB provide `K_PMON` package to manager the server.

	K_PMON.RUN_JOB : It will run PSP.WEB's pmon as repeating BG job and start all the parallel server job processes
	K_PMON.STOP : It will send signal to PSP.WEB'S pmon and server processes, and then they will quit

  To start/stop PSP.WEB server, just login as PSP.WEB engine user (normally "PSP") in sqlplus, and execute `k_pmon.run_job and k_pmon.stop`.


## Configure for the demo

	insert into ext_url_v(key, prefix) values('myself', 'http://localhost:81/');
	where the url prefix should specify the static server address, so the demo of URL will function
	
	
Install at nodeJS's side
===

## Install nodeJS and npm

  See [nodeJS official website](http://nodejs.org/#download) for the guide of installation of NodeJS and NPM.

## SSL support (optional)

	install openssl, and run
	openssl genrsa -out privatekey.pem 1024
	openssl req -new -key privatekey.pem -out certificate.csr
	openssl x509 -req -in certificate.csr -signkey privatekey.pem -out certificate.pem

## setting.js and lib/cfg.js

  lib/cfg.js set the default configuration for NodeJS side server, it's under version control and belong to the product.
So do not touch it if you don't want lose your work when update PSP.WEB to new version.
But you can copy lib/cfg.js to setting.js file and modify the setting for your own environment.
All the setting in lib/cfg.js has remarks and it's easy to understand.

## Start and Stop node gateway server

  PSP.WEB provide two types of gateway server that will route http requests to oracle plsql store procedures.
One is sole plsql page gateway server at lib/plsql.js, that's rely on NodeJS alone, and need no more other 3rd-party node modules.
The other is combined server at lib/combined.js that will serve both plsql dynamic page and static file, basicly, it rely on 3rd-party module connect.
We suggest to separate static server from main dynamic server, it will get better performance, concurrency, stability,
and more, you can use CDN for the static part.

  The oracle-port is for oracle scheduler job processes to reverse connect to NodeJS,
so NodeJS can communicate to oracle, send request and receive reply.

	node lib/plsql.js [oracle-port:1521] [http-port:80] [https-port:443] will start the server that service dynamic PL/SQL page only
	node lib/combined.js [oracle-port:1521] [http-port:80] [https-port:443] will start the server that service both dynamic PL/SQL page and static file
	
	nohup node lib/combined.js &  will start the server as a daemon.

## Install/Run static server nodeJS package (optional)


	node lib/static.js [http-port:81] will start the server that service static file only
	node lib/static_adv.js [http-port:81] will start the server that service static file(with documetation) only

  You can run static file server with plsql dynamic page server or run it separately,
and you can run static file server we provide that's based on nodeJS and connect module,
or you can run it on any static http server like Apache, lighttpd, Ngix, IIS, ...
If you deploy static file separately, please set SERVER\_CONTROL\_T.STATIC\_URL the value that point to the url of the static web server.
If you only run plsql dynamic page only, run plsql.js, and it rely on pure NodeJS installation only, no additional node modules required.
Otherwise, if you run combined server or run my static server, you need to install connect module.
Run `npm -g install connect --production` for connect installation.
If you want my static server to serve psp.web documentation, you need to install module marked, so that the .md docs can be converted to html.
If you want some of pre-translation function like markdown2html, stylus2css, you can add them as well. Use the following command to install them, they are all in the [NPM registry](http://search.npmjs.org/).

	npm -g install connect
	npm -g install stylus
	npm -g install marked

  For normal use, static.js is enough, For advanced static server, it can provide services to PSP.WEB's documentation by converting .md files to .html files, So you can read PSP.WEB documentation at http://your-static-server/doc/introduction.html.
